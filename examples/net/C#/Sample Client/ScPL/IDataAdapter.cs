		// their data plotted with. The data may not necessarily be plotted
		// with the provided axis. The PlotSurface object will employ probably
		// quite envolved heuristics to determine the actual axis used. The
		// actual axis can also be specified
		//
		// Note, the Data Adapter class is not supposed to provide the user
		// with an interface that has anything to do with axes. The user
		// deals with axes info only when dealing with PlotSurface class.
		//
		// These hint functions provide a way of passing data type (ie label,
		// time, number) info between dataadapters and axes. Otherwise no
		// other way, or extra type info objects needed.
